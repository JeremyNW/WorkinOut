    Tip(title: "5 Tips For Getting Started", text:

1. As you begin your fitness program, keep these tips in mind: Start slowly and build up gradually. Give yourself plenty of time to warm up and cool down with easy walking or gentle stretching. Then speed up to a pace you can continue for five to 10 minutes without getting overly tired.

2. Break things up if you have to. You don't have to do all your exercise at one time, so you can weave in activity throughout your day. Shorter but more-frequent sessions have aerobic benefits, too. Exercising in short sessions a few times a day may fit into your schedule better than a single 30-minute session. Any amount of activity is better than none at all.

3. Be creative. Maybe your workout routine includes various activities, such as walking, bicycling or rowing. But don't stop there. Take a weekend hike with your family or spend an evening ballroom dancing. Find activities you enjoy to add to your fitness routine.

4. Listen to your body. If you feel pain, shortness of breath, dizziness or nausea, take a break. You may be pushing yourself too hard.

5. Be flexible. If you're not feeling good, give yourself permission to take a day or two off.

1. Get a piece of paper, and write the days of the week along the side, then choose what you’ll do each day: workout or rest. To begin, plan to workout five days per week and rest two days. For most people, this is more than adequate for getting good results. Keep in mind that every workout day will not be a day of intense training or insane mileage: some days will involve hard training, others will involve only recovery or accessory work.

2. How much time can you devote to exercise?
If you can do an hour a day, that’s fantastic. But maybe you have a wife or husband, three kids, a dog, two jobs, and no robot butler…then maybe you only have thirty minutes, twice a week. That’s fine too!

3. WHERE do you want to work out?
At home? At a gym? In the park? Where you work out will largely determine if you are going to train with your body’s weight, or if you can start doing gym strength training.
If you’re paying attention here, you may notice I’m setting you up to work out no matter what your current situation is.
Why?
Because according to ACSM, the #1 reason people don’t exercise is:

They don’t have time for it.

4. SIMPLE ANSWER: Not including a warm-up set or two, I recommend:

3 to 5 sets per exercise.
8 to 10 reps per set when starting out.

5. Below is a basic formula for you to determine how long you should wait between sets, but this can be adjusted based on your level of health.

The goal is to wait the least amount of time you need, but still rest enough that you can perform all reps of the next set safely and properly!

Here’s why that’s important:

Adequate rest in-between sets will allow your body to regenerate energy, so you can execute the next set of reps with good form and technique, therefore, decreasing your risk of injury.
1-3 Reps (lifting heavy for strength/power): Rest for 3 to 5 minutes between sets.
4-7 Reps (lifting for strength): Rest for 2 to 3 minutes between sets.
8-12 Reps (lifting for size/strength): Rest for 1 to 2 minutes between sets.
13 Reps+ (lifting for endurance): Rest long enough to recover to allow you to do the next set!

    Tip(title: "Avoiding Injury", text:
        """
        Regular exercise is good for your body and safe for most everyone. However, with any type of activity, there is a chance you can get hurt. Exercise injuries can range from strains and sprains to back pain.

        With a little planning, you can prevent injury and stay safe during exercise.
        
        1. What Causes Exercise Injuries?
        Some of the most common causes of exercise injuries include:

        Exercising before your body has warmed up
        Repeating the same motion over and over again
        Not having proper form for your exercise
        Not resting in between workouts
        Pushing your body too hard or too quickly
        Doing an exercise that is too strenuous for your level of fitness
        Not using proper equipment
        
        2. Warm up and Cool Down
        Warming up before exercise gets your blood flowing, warms up your muscles, and helps you avoid injury. The easiest way to warm up is to exercise slowly for the first few minutes, then pick up the pace. For example, before running, walk briskly for 5 to 10 minutes.

        You should also cool down after exercise to bring your heart rate and body temperature back to normal. Cool down by ending your routine at a slower pace for the last 5 to 10 minutes.

        3. Choose Your Exercise Wisely
        If you have not been active, or have a health condition, talk with your health care provider to make sure you are healthy enough for exercise. Ask what types of exercise might be best for you.

        If you are new to exercise, you may want to start with low-intensity options such as:

        Walking
        Swimming
        Riding a stationary bike
        Golf
        
        These types of exercise are less likely to cause injury than higher-impact activities like running or aerobics. Contact sports like soccer or basketball are also more likely to cause injury.
        
        4. Learn Good Form
        If you are new to an exercise or sport, consider taking lessons to learn the basics. Learning the right way to do an exercise or sport can help prevent injury. Look for lessons in your community or through sports or outdoors organizations. You can also consider hiring a personal trainer.

        5. Listen to Your Body
        Forget the old saying "no pain, no gain." Of course, to build strength and stamina, you will need to push your body. The key is to push slowly and gradually. You can expect sore muscles after your workout. But you should never feel pain when exercising. If you feel pain, stop right away.

        Being tired all the time can also be a sign that you may be overdoing it. In general, avoid increasing these 3 things all at the same time:

        Number of days you exercise
        Length of time you exercise
        How hard you work out
        If you do have an injury, you can try to treat strains and sprains at home.
        
        *****
        
        When to Call the Doctor
        Call your provider for any muscle or joint pain that does not go away after self-care.

        Go to the hospital right away or call 911 or the local emergency number if:

        You have chest pain during or after exercise.
        You think you have a broken bone.
        The joint appears out of position.
        You have a serious injury or severe pain or bleeding.
        You hear a popping sound and have immediate problems using the joint.
